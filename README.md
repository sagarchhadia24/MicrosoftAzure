Create a web service that allows a user to login, and upload either: a textual note or a single picture (these may be a
grocery list, a reminder, a todo list, a picture of a bag of rice, or similar – a quick note or picture).
Each note or picture may have a one-word subject (such as “todo” or “groceries”), these subject words do not need
to be unique (there may be several grocery lists), and each note or picture may have a priority (10 is very important,
0 is not important). Each picture or note will have an upload time associated with it.
A user should be able to upload a note or picture, set the subject, and priority; or, see notes and pictures
(for that user), sorted by time and date (youngest or oldest first), or priority, or subject.
Users should be able to delete a note or picture.
Multiple users may use your service simultaneously.
You may restrict picture sizes, note sizes, and limit number of pictures and notes, per user.
